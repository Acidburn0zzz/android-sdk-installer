android-sdk-installer
=====================

Linux utility which aims to automatically install and configure Android SDK and Eclipse ADT Plugin; adds hardware support for devices; and enables full MTP support.

Scope and goal of this project is explained as part of my University Capstone project: [Adnan Hodzic - Implementation of Android SDK into Debian Linux](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/adnan-public-dl/Implementation+of+Android+SDK+into+Debian+Linux.pdf)
